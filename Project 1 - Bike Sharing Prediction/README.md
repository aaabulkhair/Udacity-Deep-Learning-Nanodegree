# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

### Program outline:

**Throughout this Nanodegree program I'm going to learn:**
 - How to implement Neural Networks using the deep learning framework PyTorch.
 - Build convolutional networks for image recognition.
 - Recurrent networks for sequence generation.
 - Generative adversarial networks for image generation.
 - Learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.
